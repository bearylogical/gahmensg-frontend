# GahmenExplorer Frontend

Frontend for [GahmenExplorer](https://gahmen.bearylogical.net). 

## About this project

GahmenExplorer aims to present information about Singapore which is typically hard to find in an accessible manner.

This came about because I was going increasingly frustrated at the lack of readily available granular data on the Singapore government. The main goal of GahmenExplorer is to provide the public with another avenue for public data to spur interest in local developments. 

More importantly, GahmenExplorer _does not_ intend to compete with the more established data platforms such as [Data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg) . Because the data on GahmenExplorer is not available on such platforms, GahmenExplorer is simply addressing the gap.
